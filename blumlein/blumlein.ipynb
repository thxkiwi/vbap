    "- Constructed using analog circuits\n",
    "- Transformers wired in a configuration to achieve sum and difference.\n",
    "- Assmuing the original currents differ only in phase, \n",
    "- The current in the difference channel will be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ differnt in phase from the current in the summation channel.\n",
    "- The difference current is then passed between two resistors *d* and *e* in series between which a capacitor (_\"condensor\"_) *f* forms a shunt arm.\n",
    "- The voltage across the capacitor f will be in phase with that in the summation channel.\n",
    "    - Passing the current in the summation channel is passed through a plain resistive attenuator network composed of series resistances *g*, *h*, and a shunt resistance *i*, a voltage is obtained which remains in phase with the voltage across the capacitor *f* in the difference channel.\n",
    "- These two voltages are then combined and separated by a sum and difference process to produce two final channels.\n",
    "    - The voltage in the first final channel will be the sum of these.\n",
    "    - The voltage in the second final channel will be the difference of these.\n",
    "    - Since these voltages were in phase the two final channels will be in phase and differ only in magnitude.\n",
    "- By choosing\n",
    "    - shunt resistance *i* in the summation channel\n",
    "    - shunt capacitance *f* in the difference channel\n",
    "    for a given frequency, any degree of amplitude difference in the final channels can be obtained for a given phase difference in the original channels.\n",
    "- For low frequencies, for a given azimuth angle (_\"obliquity of the source\"_), phase difference between waves will vary proportionately with frequency, being very small for very low frequency. \n",
    "    - The higher the frequency, the current in the difference channel will be increasingly great compared with that in the summation channel.\n",
    "    - The shunt capacitor in the difference circuit will have the effect of producing a fixed intensity difference in the final channels for a given azimuth angle at all low frequencies.\n",
    "- For higher frequencies, it is not necessary to convert phase shifts into amplitude differences,\n",
    "    - Simply reproduce amplitude differences.\n",
    "    - The shunt capacitor in the difference circuit is therefore built out with a resistance *K* whose value is substantially equal to that of resistanece *i* (the shunt resistance in the summation channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The capacitance of *f* is such that its impedance is small compared with that of the series resistances d and e over the whole working range,\n",
    "- The resistance *K* is such that it equals the reactance of the capacitor at approximately the frequnecy above which it is desired not to convert phase differences into amplitude differences.\n",
    "    - *K* is generally equal to *i*\n",
    "        - amplitude differences for high frequencies are passed on unchanged.\n",
    "- *f*, *d*, *e*, *K* are all chosen to minimize any amplitude differences that would be created by any phase differences.\n",
    "    - recalling that amplitude/phase differences in one space (L/R) are phase/amplitude differences in the other space (M/S).\n",
    "- The amount of modification to the summation and difference channels depends \n",
    "    - relative spacing of the microphones and of the loudspeakers,\n",
    "    - size and position of the perceived sound stage (_\"screen\"_, recalling that Blumlein's system was originally designed to produce a sound perceived to have originated at certain distance across an image projected onto a screen).\n",
